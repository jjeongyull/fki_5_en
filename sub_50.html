Buoyed by growing demand for AI and data centers, semiconductor exports reached a record high, serving as a key pillar of the economy. While the auto sector was hit hard by the 25% tariffs, the popularity of hybrid vehicles helped mitigate the decline in exports. However, in the second half, factors such as U.S. tariff negotiations, IT demand, and oil prices may worsen export conditions due to rising uncertainty.</div>

The Ministry of Science and ICT plans to invest KRW 65.6 billion in AI projects in the public, medical, and manufacturing sectors; KRW 30 billion in advanced AI semiconductors (NPUs); and KRW 33.7 billion in information security and AI talent development.

This better than expected result was driven by a reduction in political uncertainty, a rebound in consumer sentiment, and strong semiconductor exports. In the second half, however, export momentum may slow due to U.S. tariffs, making domestic consumption recovery and a continued trend of interest rate cuts the key variables for sustained economic growth.</div>

The remaining USD 200 billion will be deployed in strategic industries such as semiconductors, nuclear energy, secondary batteries, and biotechnology.

The initiative aims to dismantle bureaucratic silos and conflicts of interest that have hindered innovation, with a broader goal of fostering a forward-looking industrial ecosystem. Plans include relaxing data usage constraints under the Personal Information Protection Act and expanding zones for autonomous vehicle testing. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to elevate Korea to AI G3 status while also accelerating corporate growth and reforming restrictive regulations on businesses.</div>

While semiconductors (up 27%) and ships (up 46.1%) performed well, automobile exports declined 9.2% due to the continued 25% tariff.

                          <div class="swiper-txt">The Trump administration declared it would impose a 100% tariff on branded and patented pharmaceuticals starting October 1, without a grace period. The move is seen as a hardline measure to reshore pharmaceutical manufacturing. Korea may be at a disadvantage, as it lacks formal documentation of most-favored-nation (MFN) status for pharmaceuticals, unlike the EU and Japan. The exact scope of the tariffs remains unclear. Korean pharmaceutical companies are scrambling to mitigate the impact of the new tariffs through local manufacturing, inventory relocation, and strengthened partnerships.
