Located in Sangha-myeon, Gochang-gun, Jeollabuk-do, this is Sangha Farm, a place where sky and land, people and nature come together.</p>

            A Village Embracing Nature
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Spanning 99,173 ㎡ (approximately 24.5 acres), Sangha Farm is a rural theme park where the land meets the sky. It was established to promote the beauty of nature, the dedication of farmers, and the value of healthy food. Maeil Dairies, one of Korea’s top three dairy companies, developed the site in April 2016 in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and the local government of Gochang.<br>
            Nature is present in every corner of Sangha Farm. Nutritious crops flourish in the red soil of Gochang, rich in minerals and germanium. These crops are used as ingredients in the farm’s restaurants and hands-on experience classrooms. The farm is also home to over 200 animals, from adorable rabbits and chicks to goats, sheep, donkeys, and dairy cows that are rarely seen in urban areas. Watching these animals graze freely across the wide green pastures brings a sense of peace to visitors.<br>
            All buildings within Sangha Farm were constructed with a strong focus on harmony with nature in line with the Farm’s pastoral aesthetic. A hill near the sheep ranch offers a sweeping view of the entire Farm and is the most popular location for viewing sunrises and sunsets.<br>
            Sangha Farm also functions as a village hub that works closely with the local community by creating new value in agriculture and contributing to regional revitalization. Farming activities take place in the vegetable garden and smart farm, while local workshops produce ham, fruit products, and bread. Located at the entrance of the farm, the Farmers Market sells local specialties from Gochang and other parts of Jeollabuk-do Province, as well as products made on site. This initiative supports regional promotion, shared growth, and the local economy. Since its opening, Sangha Farm has created approximately 180 jobs and generates an estimated annual income of KRW 7.5 billion for local farms. The visitor experience extends well beyond agriculture. Guests can enjoy restaurants, cafés, a hotel, a glamping site, and a swimming pool where they can enjoy fresh ingredients and the comforts of nature. In July, a new stay-and-play tourism product the “Golf Package” was launched, combining healing in nature with golf rounds. It has become an increasingly popular attraction. Jin Roy Ryu, Chairman of FKI, also visited Sangha Farm this summer as part of the K-Vacance Campaign and spent his vacation immersed in nature.<br>
            As of August 2025, the Farm has welcomed over 1.7 million cumulative visitors, and this growth continues to be fueled by expansion. Farmers Village was completed in 2018, followed by the outdoor swimming pool and spa in 2020, and the glamping site in 2021. In October last year, the Sangha Arboretum opened, featuring a Healing Forest, a Hackberry Forest, and a Dolmen Forest. As a result, the farm has been featured in various entertainment programs such as 2 Days & 1 Night (KBS), Three Meals a Day (tvN), and The Hungry and the Hairy (Netflix). Numerous international institutions and government officials have also visited Sangha Farm to benchmark its model of Sixth Industry<span class="sub-tool">1</span> Today, Sangha Farm continues to serve as a vital link between local communities, farmers, and consumers, promoting a life in harmony with nature and the pursuit of healthy happiness.

          <p class="sub-p-text">
            At Sangha Farm, six artisan workshops offer wholesome flavors crafted with carefully selected natural ingredients. These include sun-dried salt and agricultural produce grown in Gochang-gun, organic milk from Maeil Dairies’ “Sangha Farm,” and eggs laid by free-range hens.<br>
            In the Ham Workshop, ham and sausage are made using 100% domestically sourced pork. The Fruit Workshop produces handcrafted jams and fruit concentrates that capture nature’s sweetness. The Castella Workshop offers moist and tender castella cakes, while the Fermentation Workshop produces marinated crabs and kimchi. The Sesame Oil Workshop produces sesame oil using a low-temperature pressing method, and the Cheese Workshop creates cheese tailored to Korean tastes by adjusting salt levels and enhancing flavor. At the Farmers Café within the farm, visitors can enjoy coffee brewed from aromatic beans and ice cream made with fresh milk.

          <p class="sub-p-text">
            There is never a dull moment at Sangha Farm, no matter the season. The farm hosts year-round interactive programs such as the sowing and harvesting of seasonal crops, as well as culinary classes that engage the five senses: where participants can see, touch, and prepare natural foods. The Petting Farm is particularly popular with children. Guests can feed milk to calves and piglets, offer carrots and hay to goats, rabbits, and deer, and enjoy meaningful moments of connection with a variety of animals.

Floor-to-ceiling windows and sunlit terraces bring the warmth of nature indoors, while the wood and natural stone used on the building’s exterior evoke the healthy fortitude of the environment.
