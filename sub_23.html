            President Lee was in attendance, and the event was joined by Korea’s Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Jeong-kwan Kim and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.<br>

            Establishing a Strategic Bridgehead for the Korea–U.S. Manufacturing Renaissance Partnership
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            At the roundtable, participants engaged in in-depth discussions on strengthening cooperation between the Korean and U.S. business communities under the theme of "Partnership for a Manufacturing Renaissance," with a particular focus on advanced and strategic industries. There was broad consensus that Korea–U.S. cooperation has been a driving force behind both countries’ development. Discussions centered on three key agenda items: advanced industries, strategic industries, and the reinforcement of supply chains. Participants also addressed emerging energy issues in the AI era and the integration of AI in cutting-edge manufacturing. They explored new avenues for defense and space cooperation and shared ambitions for joint research and technology collaboration in the biotechnology sector.<br>
            Shipbuilding, identified as a core sector for collaboration, emerged as a key area where both countries reaffirmed their commitment to expanding cooperation. With the U.S. government positioning shipbuilding revitalization as a central policy initiative, Korea widely recognized as the world leader in shipbuilding capabilities is seen as an ideal partner. A range of collaborative initiatives will be pursued to advance the shipbuilding industries of both countries. Additional discussions included areas of energy transition and supply chain cooperation, such as Korea’s new administration-led “energy expressway” initiative and the securing of critical mineral resources. The roundtable also served as a forum for mutual counsel on improving the business environments in both Korea and the United States.
