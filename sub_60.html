          A Dream Born in a Small Pharmacy
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          In May 1941, a modest four-pyeong (approximately 13.2 ㎡) storefront opened in Ahyeon-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. This was the humble origin of Gungbon Pharmacy, the predecessor to today’s Chong Kun Dang. Though shuttered two years later under colonial regulation, founder Chong-kun Lee remained undeterred. He continued as a traveling medicine vendor, eventually opening Chong Kun Dang Pharmacy in April 1946. True to his conviction to dedicate his life to pharmaceuticals, he began repackaging and selling medicines before expanding into manufacturing. In 1949, Daekwang Chemical Research Center developed the Diazol ointment, Korea’s first tube-packaged pharmaceutical. This breakthrough reflected the company’s founding philosophy: protecting public health by contributing to securing pharmaceutical sovereignty and serving the nation through the advancement of the industry.<br>
          Despite post-war instability, Chong Kun Dang was formally incorporated in 1956 15 years after receiving its initial business license in 1940. With renewed structure and upgraded facilities, the company helped shape Korea’s pharmaceutical future. In 1965, it completed the country’s largest active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) synthesis plant, and in 1968, became the first Korean drugmaker to obtain U.S. FDA approval for its in-house-produced antibiotic, Chloramphenicol. This was a turning point in an era heavily reliant on imported APIs, signaling Korea’s pharmaceutical potential on the global stage.<br>
          In 1969, Chong Kun Dang secured its first export deal with Japan’s Sankyo Pharmaceutical. That year, Chong Kun Dang’s export volume reached USD 624,548, accounting for 56.5% of Korea’s total pharmaceutical exports. In recognition, the company received the Minister of Commerce and Industry Commendation at the 6th Export Day.<br>
          Chong Kun Dang continued innovating under its current name, setting industry milestones. In 1972, it became the first Korean pharmaceutical company to establish an in-house research lab, laying the groundwork for proprietary R&D. Two years later, it completed the nation’s largest API fermentation plant, advancing raw material localization. Through diversification strategies, Chong Kun Dang went public in 1976 and transitioned to a holding company system in 2013, cementing its status as a comprehensive global pharmaceutical firm.

          Designing Health: A Diversified Portfolio
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Today, Chong Kun Dang operates as a major player in Korea’s healthcare ecosystem under the umbrella of Chong Kun Dang Holdings, alongside key affiliates such as Chong Kun Dang Bio, KyongBo Pharmaceutical, and Chong Kun Dang Healthcare. At the core is Chong Kun Dang, whose expertise in synthesis and fermentation has driven the modernization and export of Korean pharmaceuticals. Known for its strong presence in oncology, immunosuppressants, and chronic disease treatment, Chong Kun Dang has also gained consumer recognition with OTC products like Penzal Q (pain reliever) and Benfobel (active vitamin supplement). The company is also advancing in novel drug development, having introduced two new drugs Camtobel (oncology) and Duvie (diabetes) and two biosimilars, Nesbel (anemia) and Lucenby-es (macular degeneration). It is actively expanding into treatments for rare and intractable diseases, targeting unmet medical needs with first-in-class innovations.<br>
          Chong Kun Dang Bio focuses on high-value-added products through globally competitive expertise in fermentation, chemical synthesis, and biotechnology. It is particularly invested in next-generation probiotics and fermentation-based APIs. KyongBo Pharmaceutical, founded in 1987, specializes in APIs and operates across prescription drugs, OTC products, medical devices, and veterinary medicine. Chong Kun Dang Healthcare, launched in 1996, has grown into a leading brand in Korea’s health supplement market. Familiar to everyday consumers, its flagship products include Lactofit (probiotics), Eyeclear (lutein), Promega (omega-3), and I’m Vita (vitamins), available across TV home shopping, e-commerce, and retail platforms.<br>
          Chong Kun Dang’s legacy is grounded in its robust manufacturing capabilities and rigorous quality control. It now delivers holistic healthcare solutions from physical and mental well-being to improved quality of life. The company has established CKD-OTTO, a joint venture in Indonesia, and CKD USA, its U.S. R&D base. In 2023, CKD signed a large-scale out-licensing agreement with a global pharmaceutical firm for CKD-510, a promising new drug candidate, thereby expanding its spectrum as a global healthcare leader.

          A New Face Drawn Upon 84 Years of Legacy
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          This May, on the occasion of its 84th anniversary, Chong Kun Dang unveiled a new CI for the first time in nearly 50 years. More than a simple design update, this CI renewal carries deep symbolic meaning, reflecting both the company’s storied history and its aspirations for the future. Over the decades, each iteration of Chong Kun Dang’s emblem has embodied its sense of mission as a pharmaceutical company dedicated to protecting human life. In the 1950s, it expressed a commitment to improving public health. In the 1960s, it emphasized the value of life. In the 1970s, it signaled ambition for growth in an increasingly global era.<br>
          While maintaining the original structure of the symbol, the company enlarged the central bell motif to emphasize its identity and enhanced the brightness of its signature blue color to express a renewed sense of clarity and vitality. This visual evolution is also a step toward realizing the vision declared on the occasion of the company’s 80th anniversary in 2021 Creative K-healthcare DNA (CKD). Chong Kun Dang reaffirmed its mission: “From each individual to all of humanity, and from prevention to treatment, we aim to enable healthier lives through pharmaceutical innovation.”<br>
          Founded 84 years ago as a small neighborhood pharmacy, Chong Kun Dang’s new CI symbolizes the sound of the company’s bells echoing across global markets. Dedicated to advancing human health, Chong Kun Dang remains committed to healthcare innovation and to building a sustainable future.
