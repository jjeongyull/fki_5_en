          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Since debuting with BigBang in August 2006, G-Dragon has produced a series of mega-hits as both the group’s leader and as a solo artist, helping propel K-Pop onto the global stage. With a unique creative instinct, he has since expanded into the worlds of fashion and art. In 2016, he became the first Asian male to be named a global ambassador for the luxury brand Chanel. That same year, he officially launched his own fashion label, PEACEMINUSONE a virtual universe and personal persona immediately capturing widespread attention. Celebrated for its singular worldview and exclusivity, PEACEMINUSONE has since extended its influence across lifestyle sectors through high-profile collaborations with global brands such as Nike, Frédéric Malle, and Jacob & Co.

            Groundbreaking Firsts in AI Enter-Tech
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            G-Dragon continued to break new ground and take on bold new challenges by signing an exclusive contract with Galaxy Corporation, an AI enter-tech<span class="sub-tool" style="color: #eaab00;">1</span> company, in November 2023. In January 2024, he visited CES 2024 in Las Vegas, the world’s largest consumer electronics and IT exhibition, signaling a growing interest in technology. Then, in June of the same year, he was appointed as a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at KAIST. This appointment aimed to combine G-Dragon’s entertainment influence with KAIST’s scientific capabilities to enhance the global competitiveness of K-Culture.<br>
            His venture into technology soon circled back to his core identity as a musician. In February 2025, G-Dragon returned with his third studio album Übermensch, featuring the title track “Too Bad” and songs such as “Home Sweet Home.” The album title derives from the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche’s concept of the “Übermensch,” meaning “Beyond-Man,” and reflects his aspiration to transcend himself and continually evolve.<br>
            He translated this philosophy into action by integrating AI, drones, and quadruped robots into his music and stage performances, opening new horizons in AI Enter-Tech. In March 2025, during his first solo concert in eight years, G-Dragon 2025 World Tour Übermensch In Korea, he captivated an audience of over 65,000 with a drone show that lit up the night sky with his image and the Übermensch logo. The performance of “Bullshit” featured a quadruped robot, customized with G-Dragon’s direct involvement, showcasing a stage that blurred the line between art and technology.<br>
            In collaboration with KAIST, G-Dragon transmitted AI-generated art based on his iris data into space via a 13-meter antenna, as well as his music track “Home Sweet Home,” in April 2025. This project was part of NASA’s SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) initiative and this makes G-Dragon the first Korean artist to participate in the SETI project. The production of the “Home Sweet Home” music video also drew attention: it was co-produced by Galaxy Corporation using Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI platform Sora, with G-Dragon actively demonstrating the evolving role of artists as creative technologists. In a further milestone, he became the first Korean artist to showcase a media art video at Sphere, the world’s largest LED dome located in Las Vegas. The piece, titled “One Spirit, One Team,” was projected at the iconic venue, marking yet another significant first in his career.

            A Global Icon of Creativity and Innovation
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            G-Dragon continues to expand his influence beyond his fandom by offering immersive experiences in AI enter-tech to the general public. In March, he hosted a media art exhibition and released special merchandise at The Hyundai Seoul in Yeouido to commemorate the launch of Übermensch. The exhibition, which integrated cutting-edge technologies, has since been showcased in Japan and Taiwan. As an artist affiliated with Galaxy Corporation and a visiting professor in mechanical engineering at KAIST, G-Dragon has played a pivotal role in advancing AI enter-tech. In April, the AI Enter-Tech Research Center was established at KAIST’s Daejeon campus, where joint research is underway to develop AI-based platforms and global content technologies.<br>
            Galaxy Corporation, which supports G-Dragon’s vision for AI enter-tech, was officially approved for membership in the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) in August. Earlier this year, at its annual general meeting in February, FKI welcomed a number of leading domestic IT and tech companies as members. Galaxy Corporation’s admission aligns with FKI’s broader strategy to extend collaboration beyond traditional manufacturing sectors and into emerging industries.<br>
            In line with this trajectory, G-Dragon was appointed as an official ambassador for the APEC 2025 Economic Leaders’ Meeting. His experimental spirit transcending the boundaries of art and science and his symbolic presence as an icon of creativity and innovation were key factors in this selection. These attributes also resonate with the priorities of APEC 2025, scheduled to launch in Gyeongju this October: Connect, Innovate, Prosper. Today, G-Dragon’s stage extends far beyond the concert hall. As a global icon who brings his unique creativity and innovation to life, he continues to pioneer new frontiers.
