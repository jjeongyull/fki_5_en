                Investment Plans of Top 500 Companies for the Second Half of 2025
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                Despite growing geopolitical and economic uncertainty, nearly 8 out of 10 large corporations (78.4%) plan to maintain their investment levels in the second half of this year. FKI announced these findings based on a survey conducted by research firm Mono Research of Korea’s top 500 companies by revenue (with 120 firms responding).<br>
                According to the survey, 78.4% of responding companies plan to invest at a level similar to the first half. Meanwhile, 13.3% responded that they would reduce investment, and 8.3% indicated an increase. FKI explained that although companies have shown caution toward new investments amid growing export uncertainty and prolonged sluggish domestic demand, many appear ready to maintain investment levels on expectations of economic stimulus measures and improving market conditions under the new administration.

                Export Outlook for the Second Half of 2025
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                A recent survey revealed that uncertainties surrounding tariffs imposed by the United States are expected to be the most significant variable affecting Korea’s exports in the second half of the year. FKI conducted the “H2 2025 Export Outlook Survey” through Mono Research, targeting the top 1,000 firms by revenue engaged in Korea’s ten leading export industries* (with 150 companies responding).<br>
                According to the findings, Korean companies project that exports in the second half of the year will decrease by an average of 1.6% compared to the same period last year. While four sectors including electronic components (1.3%) and biohealth (1.6%) are expected to see export growth, six sectors including steel (–5.0%) and shipbuilding (–2.5%) are forecast to experience declines. When asked about the greatest export risk in the second half, 53.3% of export companies identified “Trump administration tariff policies,” followed by “demand contraction from global low growth” (14.0%) and “escalation of U.S.–China trade conflict” (12.7%).<br>

                FKI Donates KRW 500 Million to Support Flood Recovery
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                The Korean business community has stepped up to support recovery efforts following the record-breaking torrential rains that struck the country this summer, causing dozens of casualties and over 4,000 cases of property damage nationwide. On July 22, FKI donated KRW 500 million to the Korea Disaster Relief Association. FKI Chairman Jin Roy Ryu stated, “It is deeply regrettable that such widespread damage has occurred just as we are striving to overcome the downturn in regional economies and domestic demand,” and urged companies to unite in taking an active role in the recovery effort. Separately, Poongsan Group also contributed KRW 500 million to support flood recovery.

                Opening Ceremony for First “Honor Store” to Mark the 80th National Liberation Day
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                On August 13, FKI held a plaque-hanging ceremony for the first store participating in its “Honor Store” (Store of Distinction and Honor) initiative, a support program for small business owners who are descendants of independence patriots. The project is a public-private partnership launched in celebration of the 80th National Liberation Day of Korea, jointly promoted by the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs, KB Financial Group, Heritage of Korean Independence, and Habitat for Humanity Korea. Designed to upgrade the business premises and boost the pride of descendants of distinguished contributors to the Independence Movement, the initiative provides space renovations as well as business consulting and other forms of support.<br>
              The first store selected was “Palette Art School,” operated by Soo-jeong Kim, great-granddaughter of independence activist Hyuk Kim. Improvements included exterior repairs, new signage, interior remodeling, and plumbing renovations. The upgrades will facilitate the establishment in providing a safer and more pleasant learning environment where local children can pursue their dreams and talents.

                The Economic Cost of Inactive Youth and Policy Implications
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                As of July, the number of young adults in their 20s who reported doing neither work nor job-seeking activities reached 421,000, the highest figure on record. A study commissioned by FKI and conducted by Professor Mi-suk Lee of Changwon National University, titled “Economic Cost Estimation of the Rise in Inactive Youth,” estimated that the economic loss resulting from this trend over the past five years (2019–2023) totalled KRW 44.5 trillion.<br>
                Sang-ho Lee, head of FKI’s Economic and Industrial Research Department, stressed the need for tailored policy responses that reflect the diverse characteristics of inactive youth, along with broader efforts to stimulate domestic demand, ease regulations, and enhance corporate vitality to create new job opportunities.
