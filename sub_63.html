                FILA Holdings Announces Name Change to Misto Holdings
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                FILA Holdings announced that its shareholders approved the decision to change the company name to Misto Holdings during the general meeting held on March 31. This name change marks a significant milestone in the company’s journey to solidify its identity as a global brand portfolio company, expanding beyond the limitations of a single brand image. Despite the name change, all brands under Misto Holdings, including FILA, will continue to operate independently, maintaining their unique identities.<br>
                The new name Misto, derived from the Italian word for "harmony," "blend," or "diversity," reflects the company’s commitment to connecting diverse possibilities and driving creative change.<br>
                In conjunction with the name change, Misto Holdings has developed a new corporate color and logo, and introduced four core values: Synergetic, Empowering, Resilient, and Responsible. As captured in its slogan "Redefining Boundaries,” the company’s new corporate identity is focused on generating synergies among its brands and embracing all possibilities across its portfolio.<br>
                Misto Holdings has also launched a newly revamped official website. To ensure effective communication with existing customers, updates and relevant information will be provided through various channels.

                KG Group Celebrates 40th Anniversary, Pledges Leap Toward the Next 100 Years
              </p>
              <p class="sub-p-text">
                KG Group held a commemorative ceremony on August 30 at COEX in Samseong-dong, Seoul to mark its 40th anniversary. The event, held just ahead of the company’s founding day on September 1, was a meaningful occasion to reflect on four decades of challenge and growth, while reaffirming its commitment to a sustainable future over the next 100 years.<br>
                Held under the slogan “40 Years Together, 100 More to Come”, the ceremony brought together approximately 1,500 employees and their families. Attendees celebrated the spirit of KG’s founding and shared the company’s commitments to social contribution, ESG initiatives, and long-term vision. As part of the event, the Sunhyun Foundation scholarship ceremony awarded grants to 27 individuals, including future talents selected from across the country and heroic firefighters. To date, more than 1,000 students have received support through the Sunhyun scholarship program, with cumulative funding reaching KRW 1.8 billion. The program has become a key representation of KG’s ESG efforts and ongoing commitment to social contribution.<br>
                The 40th anniversary celebration went beyond a conventional ceremony. It served as a platform to showcase KG’s history and philosophy, its sense of social responsibility, engagement with arts and culture, and its close relationship with employees. The event featured a scholarship presentation, performances by an employee choir and orchestra, and a special segment recognizing the company’s first-ever employee. Through these elements, the event delivered a message of trust and solidarity as KG advances toward the next century.<br>
                KG Group plans to go beyond enhancing competitiveness in its core industries such as automotive, steel, and chemicals. The company is also committed to making a positive impact in education, culture, and the environment, realizing its vision of becoming a “respected company that everyone is proud of.”
